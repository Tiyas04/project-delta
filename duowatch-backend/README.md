# Backend Overview

This backend is built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB** and serves as the API layer for the Blog project.

## Core Technologies

- **Express.js**: Lightweight Node.js framework used for routing, middleware, and API handling.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store blog data in flexible JSON-like documents.
- **Mongoose**: ODM used to define schemas and interact with MongoDB more easily.

## Backend Responsibilities

- Handle incoming HTTP requests and send API responses.
- Connect to MongoDB and manage data operations.
- Organize application logic into routes, controllers, models, and middleware.
- Support authentication, validation, and error handling where needed.

## Other Packages in the Repository

Depending on the project setup, the repository may also include packages such as:

- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **cors**: Enables cross-origin requests from the frontend.
- **nodemon**: Automatically restarts the server during development.
- **bcryptjs**: Hashes sensitive data such as passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Creates and verifies authentication tokens.
- **express-validator**: Validates incoming request payloads.

## Typical Workflow

1. Install dependencies.
2. Set environment variables like `PORT` and `MONGO_URI`.
3. Connect the Express app to MongoDB.
4. Register middleware and route handlers.
5. Start the server and test the endpoints.

## Summary

This backend provides a simple and scalable foundation for the Blog application using Express and MongoDB, with supporting packages for development, security, and request handling.
